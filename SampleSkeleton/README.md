# SampleSkeleton (change this)
Unity version: [version]

Description of the sample. Please provide enough info and links to Unity documentation for the sample to actually be useful. Feel free to add sections, screenshots, etc.

Please, *do not* publish code-only samples. Those quickly become dead weight because no one is able to make sense of them down the road.

Everyone likes pictures, so don't be shy to add some like this: `![Description](Documentation~/screenshot.png)`.

## Instructions
- Create the Unity project or package. For multiple versions of a sample, store them in separate subfolders (e.g. `unity-project-2019` and `unity-project-2020`) and copy/move the `.gitignore` there.
- Include only the required Assets and try to reuse those from other samples to keep the repository's size under control. For example, don't keep all Assets from the HDRP or URP Unity templates unless they are relevant for the sample.
- Don't keep extra unneeded packages in the project (e.g. profiler tools, unless relevant).
- Write a title, description and Unity version(s) used above.
- Add an entry to the `README.md` at the root of this repository.
- Delete this Instructions section and everything below.
- Submit a PR.

### Coding standard
Please follow Unity's coding standard available on Ono in `unity-extra/unity-meta/ReferenceSource/CSharp/Assets/CSharpReference.cs`.
